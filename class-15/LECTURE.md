# Class 15: Project Week Kickoff

## Code Review

- Getting our todos completed.
  - Victor: reading code that we didn't write ourselves.
    - Each JS file is working together, not necessarily in a way that might be intuitive.
  - Matthew: How important it is to have functions that do specific jobs.
    - When nothing happens on the page, how do you know what went wrong!
    - Using console logs to give proof that things are what we expected.
      - Our first exposure to validating some code.
  - Mal: Figuring out how to get assets images displaying.
  - Paulo: .eslintrc.json
    - This file configure a es (ecma script), lint (lint), rc, json (javascript).
    - getting a typeError on 'this.items' in the cart contructor.
  - Fizzo: looking at localStorage to see what is getting added by our code.
    - Logging items from localStorage.
    - grabbing elements from CSS feels a bit crazy without ids.
      - Using the DOM to add ids yourself.
